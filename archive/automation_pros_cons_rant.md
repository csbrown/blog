Being in a field in which I work frequently with computers and technology, I frequently see arguments over whether automation is a good thing.
 I would like to take a moment to address a very small slice of this debate, which I feel is an important slice, and is non-obvious, and thus requires a somewhat deeper investigation than public debates are typically amenable to.

To back-track a little, the two sides of the automation debate take positions with foundations on entirely different premises, which I see often in public debates - the average good vs the individual good.
 Such arguments typically take the form of: Side 1: "but if we do X, then the average Y will increase/decrease/whatever!", Side 2: "but if we do not(X), then some individuals' Y will increase/decrease/whatever!".
 These sides can almost never be reconciled because the span between the "average good" premise and the "individual good" premise is both deep and wide.
 I therefore typically simply excuse myself from such debates, debate being pointless.
 However, I sometimes see the makings of a rickety rope bridge between the two, and feel obliged to investigate, and then to share when I find it sturdy enough to support a crossing.

In any case, here is the general form of the debate.
 I put these two claims in quotes because I actually extracted them from a comment thread on a blog in which this debate was raging.

Claim 1:

"any job that can be automated should be."

Claim 2:

"We really need to think on what to do with those displaced workers because ... crawl away and drink or do opioids until they die ... is exactly what's happening in much of parts of the country"


The underlying premise of Claim 1 is that *average* production/efficiency/whatever will go up if we automate process X, and that therefore automation is an "average good". 
Claim 2 pretty obviously hinges on the "individual good". 

However, somewhat counterintuitively, it may or may not be the case that the "average good" goes up in the presence of automation, even if that automation performs the job more efficiently.

Consider the following counterexample:

Sally sells seashells by the seashore. 
 Alice automates abalone accumulators with an ALGOL application. 
 Sally requires $10/unit_work. 
 Alice requires $30/unit_work, but due to "automation" can perform Sally's job in a quarter of the time. 
 Thus, for one unit of Sally work, Sally costs $10, and Alice only costs $7.5. 
 Seashore Shells Syndicate therefore, obviously, fires Sally, hires Alice, and, assuming free-market magic, we all enjoy cheaper seashells (or at least they are not more expensive, even without free-market magic).

Thus, it seems as though the "average good" goes up. 
 However, note that Alice and Sally are still capable of producing things, and this has an effect on the "average good".
 So, what they would be doing with their time otherwise is important not just for their well-being, but from a production/efficiency/whatever standpoint as well. 
 Notably, if Sally crawls away and drinks or does opiods until she dies, her production capacity is simply *lost*. 
 Recall that Sally's work, in the presence of automation, is still worth $7.5/unit_work to the seashell market.
 
So, let us make a few assumptions to simply illustrate the *possibility* of an outcome: 
 Assume that Alice, if not hired by Seashore Shells Syndicate, would perform some equally worthwhile work
 Suppose that seashells are worth $15 (they must be of greater value than Sally's wage, otherwise she would never have been working there). 
 Sally, selling seashells, generates $15 of value in exchange for $10. 
 Her net value to the economy is, therefore, $5. 
 In other words, everyone else, averaged together, realizes a net benefit from Sally's employ. 
 Let Alice's net value to the economy if she works at Seashore Shells Syndicate be $X (since we don't know what else she is doing with her other 3/4 work_units). 
 Since we have assumed that she would still be performing worthwhile work elsewhere, even if she didn't work at SSS, her value to the economy is $X regardless. 
 I.e., Alice is worth $X whether or not Sally's job gets automated.
 Therefore, if Sally loses her job to automation and turns to drugs and alcohol and is otherwise unproductive, the economy loses $5. 
 In other words, it is not just Sally who loses, the "average person" loses. 
 This is strange, because it seems as though the overall outcome of the thing is cheaper seashells, and since everyone loves seashells, everyone who isn't Sally and Alice should benefit.
 However, again, this neglects the fact that either Alice or Sally or both are of value outside of seashell-selling, and thus their created value doing whatever else must be taken into account to compute the net effect on the "average good".

This is because Sally's work *is of some value*. 
 By not employing Sally to do *anything*, we are wasting that value. 
 This is entirely possible in the modern economy in the presence of minimum wages, etc, since if Sally's value falls below the minimum wage, she must necessarily do nothing, and what value she still possesses is wasted. 
 It is therefore possible that, for example, even if fast-food workers can be "automated" for slightly cheaper than the amount for which they can be employed, it is not clear that anyone except Burgdonald-fil-a will reap any rewards from said automation. 
 Indeed, along with Sally, we may all suffer because of it. 
 Of course, this is merely a possibility: the actual outcome on the "average good" depends on how the numbers actually crunch out.
 
On the other hand, if we can put Sally to work creating the same value, or nearly the same value that she was creating by selling seashells then the "average good" goes up.
 If, at the same time, Sally and Alice both manage to make the same wage, then it is pretty clear that automation was the correct path.
 If either Sally or Alice suffer, but the "average good" goes up, then we are simply left with the "individual good" vs "average good" yelling match.
 The third possibility pointed out with the illustration above, namely, that is is possible that Sally and/or Alice suffer and, at the same time, the "average good" goes down, then it is pretty clear that, at the very least, we need to remedy Alice/Sally's potential unemployment before automating the sale of seashells.
 
In conclusion, the value of automation hinges *crucially* upon what happens to the displaced workers, because "crawling away and drinking or doing opiods until they die" is not of any value to anyone.

Cheers,
-Scott!
